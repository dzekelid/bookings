         The result is limited by the permissions of the apiKey.
         <p/>
         It is possible to filter by time booked and/or time of the last change.
         To filter by time booked, the parameters startTime and endTime are required.
         To filter by last time changed, the parameters lastUpdatedStartTime and lastUpdatedEndTime are required.
         It is possible to filter by both at the same time. At least one of the two filters must be used.
         <p/>
         It is further possible to filter by product id.
         <p/>
         Do not use this method to periodically poll for new/changed bookings. Use webhooks (see API general documentation) instead.
